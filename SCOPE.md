# PageAI Project Scope

## Features

1. LLM Integration:
   - Integrate a large language model (LLM) as the core AI component.
   - Ensure the LLM can be easily swapped or updated in the future.

2. Component Library Access:
   - Provide the LLM with access to a component library.
   - Design the system to allow for swapping different component libraries.

3. Figma Design Upload:
   - Implement functionality to upload Figma web page designs.
   - Develop a parser to extract relevant information from Figma files.

4. Design Analysis:
   - Process uploaded designs to identify and locate different components on the page.
   - Develop algorithms to recognize layout structures and element positioning.

5. Component Identification:
   - Analyze identified components to determine their type and purpose.
   - Create a mapping system between Figma elements and general component concepts.

6. Component Library Matching:
   - Develop a system to match identified components with equivalent components from the provided library.
   - Implement fuzzy matching or AI-based recommendations for best-fit components.

7. Prop Value Determination:
   - Analyze the Figma design to extract relevant style and property information.
   - Develop algorithms to translate Figma styles into component library-specific prop values.
   - Ensure adherence to the component library's design system and constraints.

8. Scaffolding Generation:
   - Create a code generation system that uses the matched components and determined prop values.
   - Generate a basic project structure with necessary files and folders.
   - Implement a templating system for consistent code output.

## Target Audience

- Businesses that want to automate website creation from Figma designs.
- Companies with established internal component libraries looking to streamline their design-to-code process.
- Organizations seeking to reduce manual coding efforts in translating designs to functional websites.

## Use Cases

1. Rapid prototyping of web pages based on Figma designs.
2. Automating the initial coding phase of web development projects.
3. Ensuring consistency between design and implementation by leveraging existing component libraries.
4. Reducing time-to-market for web projects by accelerating the design-to-code pipeline.
5. Enabling designers to generate initial code scaffolding without deep coding knowledge.

## Key Considerations

- Accuracy of component recognition and matching.
- Flexibility to work with various component libraries and design systems.
- User-friendly interface for uploading designs and configuring the generation process.
- Code quality and adherence to best practices in the generated scaffolding.
- Scalability to handle complex designs and large component libraries.
